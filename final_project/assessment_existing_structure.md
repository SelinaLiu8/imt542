# ðŸ§© Assessment of Existing Information Structures

## Criterion 1: Understanding Original Structure and Access

- **Source**: Investopedia.com, a public educational resource for financial definitions.
- **Original Structure**: Unstructured HTML web pages, each representing one definition topic.
- **Access Method**:
  - No official API provided
  - Requires direct HTML scraping using known element IDs and class patterns
  - Each article follows a predictable URL pattern: `https://www.investopedia.com/terms/<first-letter>/<term>.asp`
- **Portability Challenges**:
  - No machine-readable format
  - Inconsistent internal tagging of content
  - Data not reusable without transformation

## Criterion 2: Quality and Performance Analysis

- **Quality**:
  - Human-readable and high editorial standard
  - Machine-level access limited due to structural inconsistency
  - Some terms have both short and long definitions in different HTML elements
- **Performance**:
  - Initial single-term scraping returns results in ~1â€“2 seconds
  - Performance degrades under repeated load or if rate-limited by the source
  - Requires fallback mechanisms to maintain success rate
