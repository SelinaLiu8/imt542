    <h1>Availability, Limitations, Ethics, and Societal Impact Statement</h1>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
    Our product is a beginner-friendly stock visualization application designed to simplify stock data exploration and promote financial literacy. It leverages publicly available financial data from APIs such as Alpha Vantage and Yahoo Finance. All data sources are referenced transparently within the application. The product adheres to the FAIR principlesâ€”ensuring data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
    </p>
    <p>
    The application is portable and can be deployed across platforms. It is built using web standards (React, Redux, and REST APIs), and the containerized version supports deployment through Docker. The use of standardized data formats and metadata supports semantic interoperability, in line with OECD 2021 guidance on data portability.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
    The tool simplifies financial data and is meant for <strong>educational and informational purposes only</strong>. It does not support real-time trading, portfolio tracking, or personalized investment advice. Due to limited scope, the app does not provide deep financial analytics or predictive modeling.
    </p>
    <p>
    The data sources used may include inconsistencies, outdated pricing, or delays, which can affect the accuracy of visualizations. Users must verify insights with authoritative financial services before making any investment decisions. The app also lacks accessibility features such as full screen reader support or localization.
    </p>

    <h2>Ethics</h2>
    <p>
    Our ethical framework integrates virtue ethics, consequentialism, and non-consequentialism as outlined in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10402.pdf" target="_blank">arXiv:2205.10402</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Virtue Ethics:</strong> The app was designed with an emphasis on accessibility, clarity, and transparency. We strived to reduce financial intimidation for beginners and provide intuitive navigation without advertising or user tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Consequential Ethics:</strong> While the app can help demystify stock data and democratize access to market insights, it may also lead inexperienced users to misinterpret trends without full financial context. To mitigate risks, we have included educational tooltips, disclaimers, and clearly labeled charts.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Consequential Ethics:</strong> Respecting users' data privacy is a foundational principle. The app does not collect personal data, track behavior, or use cookies. API requests are handled client-side, and no user accounts are required, eliminating exposure to identity risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Societal Impact</h2>
    <p>
    The stock app has the potential to foster early interest in financial literacy and empower non-experts to engage with market data confidently. By simplifying complex charts and removing jargon, the app lowers the entry barrier to financial exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, there is a societal risk if users misinterpret visualizations as financial guidance or if accessibility limitations exclude certain user groups. Future updates aim to improve support for mobile devices, expand accessibility, and include bias-reducing features such as highlighting data uncertainty or volatility.
    </p>
    <p>
    To encourage responsible use, we will continue gathering user feedback and maintaining documentation to promote clarity and caution in financial data interpretation.
    </p>
